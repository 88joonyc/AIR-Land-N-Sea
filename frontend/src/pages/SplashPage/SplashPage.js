When you‚Äôre booking your first trip, you‚Äôll go through a quick approval process by entering your driver‚Äôs license and some other information. In most cases, you‚Äôll get approved immediately, and you‚Äôll be set for every future road trip, business trip, and family vacation!</div>

                            <div className='freq-3 freq-ques' hidden={true}>No, you don‚Äôt need personal insurance coverage to book a car on Air Land-N-Sea. <br/><br/> In the US, any personal insurance you may have that covers damage to the host‚Äôs vehicle would kick in before your Air Land-N-Sea protection plan, except in limited situations for trips booked in Maryland. When booking a car in the US, you‚Äôll choose between three protection plans ‚Äî Premier, Standard, or Minimum ‚Äî to get the level of coverage that‚Äôs right for you. With each plan, you‚Äôre covered with third-party automobile liability insurance provided under a policy issued to Air Land-N-Sea by Liberty Surplus Insurance Corporation, a member of the Liberty Mutual Group ‚Äî $750,000 for the Premier plan.* <br/><br/> When booking a car in Canada, you‚Äôll choose between three protection plans ‚Äî Premier, Standard, or Minimum ‚Äî and with each plan, you‚Äôre covered with liability insurance purchased from Intact Financial Corporation in Alberta, Nova Scotia, Ontario, and Quebec, and Insurance Corporation of British Columbia (ICBC) in British Columbia ‚Äî up to $2,000,000 for all plans.** <br/>When booking a car in the United Kingdom, you‚Äôll also choose between the Premier, Standard, and Minimum protection plans. Each plan includes different limits of financial responsibility for physical damage, but all three plans include up to ¬£20,000,000 coverage under a third-party automobile liability insurance policy provided by Aioi Nissay Dowa Insurance UK Ltd. via Air Land-N-Sea broker Aon UK Ltd.**</div>

                            <div className='freq-4 freq-ques' hidden={true}>Yes, many hosts offer delivery to travel hubs like airports, train stations, and hotels, or to custom delivery locations. There are cars available on Air Land-N-Sea near hundreds of airports, or you can have your car delivered for pickup and return at your hotel or vacation rental to save time and hassle.

                            <div className='freq-5 freq-ques' hidden={true}>Yes, multiple guests can drive the car you book on Air Land-N-Sea, as long as they are all approved to drive. The primary driver (whoever booked the car) can add additional drivers with no fees or additional charges. Only the primary driver can request to add drivers; Air Land-N-Sea hosts cannot do it for you. We encourage you to request to add additional drivers before your trip starts, though guests in the US and Canada can request to add a driver while a trip is in progress. <br/><br/> To speed up the process, have your additional driver create a Air Land-N-Sea account and get approved to drive before you request to add them. All drivers must have a valid driver‚Äôs license and meet the age requirements for the car you‚Äôve booked. You can request to add drivers via the ‚ÄúTrips‚Äù tab in the Air Land-N-Sea app without additional driver charges or extra costs.</div>

                            <div className='freq-6 freq-ques' hidden={true}>Many Air Land-N-Sea hosts offer discounted prices for weekly and monthly trips, as well as ‚Äúearly bird‚Äù discounts for trips booked a week or more in advance.

                            <div className='freq-7 freq-ques' hidden={true}>You can cancel and get a full refund up to 24 hours before your trip starts. If you book a trip with less than 24 hours‚Äô notice, you have one hour after booking to cancel free of charge. If you cancel after the free cancellation period ends, you will be charged a small cancellation fee. <br/><br/> In the rare event a host cancels, you‚Äôll be notified immediately so you can book another car, or we‚Äôll help you find one. Your refund can be temporarily held to expedite rebooking, or the funds can be returned to your bank account ‚Äî your choice.</div>
